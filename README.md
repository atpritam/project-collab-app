## Architecture

Nudge is built on a modern, microservices-oriented architecture:

- **Frontend Container**: Next.js application serving the user interface
- **Backend Container**: Express API providing business logic and data access
- **Database Container**: PostgreSQL instance for persistent storage

The application uses a RESTful API for most operations, with Socket.io for real-time features like messaging and status updates.
